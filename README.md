# Purpose
The purpose of creating this website was to act as a portfolio that can be presented to potential employers to showcase the expertise and experience I have as (an aspiring) full stack web developer and IT professional. This involved providing information regarding my skill set, expertise and qualifications through:
- Work Experience (Link to Resume/CV)
- Educational History
- Completed/in progress projects
- Testimonials

It was also important to show employers content regarding my personality and interests. This was attempted to be highlighted through:
- Blog posts
- Website theme/style
- Text content
- Miscellaneous (e.g. playlist)

<b>NOTE:</b> All external links are noted as green blocks on the sitemap. The red line leading up to these external links on the sitemap signify the page will be opened on a new tab.

## Structure
The structure of the website can be separated into 3x sections. "Core content" found on the main pages (top & second level), supplementary content which are links found on the main pages (third level) & external links.

The target audience of this website are for employers who are looking to engage a dev and/or IT professional. Therefore, it is critical that the website not only displays content that protrays the skills and professional knowledge the employer is looking for, but the structure of the website should also aim to get the employer to start a conversation with the developer. The structure aims to do this in three main ways.

### Path to the Contact Page
Firstly, the structure of the website allows the viewer to navigate to the contact page without having to use the navigation bar. Each page leads to the next, until the viewer either downloads the developer's CV or contacts them via the contact form. This is done by attempting to have the viewer complete these actions at the end of the first page, right after they see the developers experience, education and testimonials. If the viewer was not yet convinced, the website prompts the viewer to find out more about the developer through internal links generally right after the main content of each page. This will continue as the viewer sees the developers about page, projects and finally ends up at the contact page. This structure ensures that the viewer will see a call of action to contact the developer at least once throughout their time on the website.

### Early Visible Testimonials
![Snippet of Portfolio Home Page](./docs/portfolio-home-snippet.png)

The home page is key in drawing in the attention of the viewer.
The website's home page is structured with a large 'hero' area to help draw in the attention of the viewer. The hero area provides a brief portion of text which bold key words that an employer would be looking for. Once the viewer's attention is caught, they are shortly greeted by a grid of testimonials. Gaining the trust of the viewer provides the ability to have a better chance of them reaching out and conducting business with the developer. Various reports (such as the one linked [here](https://au.business.trustpilot.com/guides-reports/build-trusted-brand/why-and-how-social-proof-influences-consumers)) suggests that consumers solely relied on advertisements and word of mouth in the past, however in today's time, social proof is the key driver is gaining a customers trust.

<i>The most Effective Trust Signals Survey Results - sourced from Trustpilot, "The Psychology behind trust signals: Why and how social proof influences consumers" - dated 13th September 2019</i>

In the above article, it was noted that in a survey of more than 1600 people (150 of who lived in Australia), approximately 98% of buyers would be more interested in purchasing with a provider if they can recognise at least one trust signal. Additionally more than 60% of those surveyed advised that they were more likely to purchase due to the trust signal/s they identified. The most positively deemed trust signal was highly rated ratings and reviews. Providing social proof at the beginning of the home page with glowing reviews of the developer's work allows the viewer to gain a sense of trust even before they've started scrolling, allowing the rest of their time on the website to be more positive. 

### Retaining Attention
Although there are external links that can be found throughout the website, these are kept to a minimal and can only be seen in a small section of the about page (playlist section). The remainder of the website attempts to keep the viewer engaged by leading them to the next page of content and information. To ensure that attention is retained, all external links have used (target="_blank") to make external links open on new tabs. This increases the chance that the website does not close and lose the attention of the viewer.

### Contactability
The main component which assists the viewer to contact the developer is through the accessiblity of the contact page in the header/navigation bar and the social media icons found in the footer. For every page the viewer reaches the end of, the links to the developer's social media and email account is seen in the footer to make it easier for the viewer to contact the dev. Not only this, but there are various points throughout the website which calls the viewer to action and contact the developer. This is noted in the homepage introduction paragraph, as well as the secondary contact form found at the bottom of the homepage titled "Let's Work Together". 


# Wireframes
There are 12x wireframes for each viewport ([mobile](./docs/wireframes-mobile/), [tablet](./docs/wireframes-tablet/) and [laptop](./docs/wireframes-laptop/)). Therefore a total of 36 wireframes were made to provide an idea of how the layout of each component will change when viewing from different viewports. A .png of each wireframe for each viewport can be located in their respective folder within the /docs directory (HendricWidjaja-t1a2/docs). Please view these files in conjunction when reading this wireframes overview.
