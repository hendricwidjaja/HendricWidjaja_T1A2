# Purpose
The purpose of creating this website was to act as a portfolio that can be presented to potential employers to showcase the expertise and experience I have as (an aspiring) full stack web developer and IT professional. This involved providing information regarding my skill set, expertise and qualifications through:
- Work Experience (Link to Resume/CV)
- Educational History
- Completed/in progress projects
- Testimonials

It was also important to show employers content regarding my personality and interests. This was attempted to be highlighted through:
- Blog posts
- Website theme/style
- Text content
- Miscellaneous (e.g. playlist)

# Wireframes
There are 12x wireframes for each viewport ([mobile](./docs/wireframes-mobile/), [tablet](./docs/wireframes-tablet/) and [laptop](./docs/wireframes-laptop/)). Therefore a total of 36 wireframes were made to provide an idea of how the layout of each component will change when viewing from different viewports. A .png of each wireframe for each viewport can be located in their respective folder within the /docs directory (HendricWidjaja-t1a2/docs). Please view these files in conjunction when reading this wireframes overview.
